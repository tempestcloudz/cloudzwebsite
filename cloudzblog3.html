  <h1>Everything is shiny</h1>
  <p><strong>December 10, Wednesday, or December 9 for you western folk.</strong></p>
  <p>As the title says, everything is now shiny, learned sum CSS and learned how to make my website look less depressing!! Unfortunately the new onslaught of tags that were introduced (Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code) are really messing me up, so I'll stop here with the shiny CSS for today. Overall jovial process, frustration and struggle is neccessary for growth, at least that's what they say haha</p>
  
  <h3>Before:</h3>
  <p title="not shiny"><img src= "after.png" alt="didn't load? check ur internet connection" height="400" width="800"> </p>
  <h3>After:</h3>
  <p title="wow so shiny"><img src= "shiny.png" alt="didn't load? check ur internet connection" height="400" width="800"> </p> <br>
  
  <p>That's most of it, aside from that I've not done much, I <em>do</em> have plans to add an archive page, so that yalls can see the old versions of the website, I'll get to it eventually, school time <b title="nice typo">constraitns</b> and all.</p><br>
  
  <p>That's all, folks!</p>
