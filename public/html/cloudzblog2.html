  <h1>Day 2, of the Neocities</h1>
  <p><strong>December 9, Tuesday (or december 8 for you western folk)</strong></p>
  <p>There's really not much to say, but, progress! Today wasn't quite as eventful, school gets in the way of things, and school always brings time restraints. As such, the updates are... minimal. Today was spent learning on htmldog and coding little snippets on the website.</p>
