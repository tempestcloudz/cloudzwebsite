    <h1>Entering the Neocities</h1>
    <p> <b>Monday, December 8, 2025 (or december 7 for you westerners)</b><br>
    Well, seems I've stumbled upon quite the landscape. As for how I discovered this place, hohoh... it was quite the arduous journey, I scaled mountains, slew
    terrible beasts--who am I kidding, I found it on [Youtube]. The process of learning HTML, CSS, and JS however is more akin to that flamboyant story I mentioned
    . Metaphorically of course, in what world would I have to face behemoths to learn how to make words bold in some silly website. </p>
    
          <p>How'd the journey go, you may ask? Humble beginnings, in computer class I was graced with a very poorly done introduction to HTML, this is mainly due
      to our teachers incompetence, not even teaching us the material! This meant however that me and the class could do stupid stuff on the computers, but I
      digress. As for the recent escapades, they've been with simple courses from W3Schools, quite the source, however the ones Neocities suggests have given me 
      quite more fulfillment. On the topic of neocities, I used their simple tutorial for HTML for a bit of introduction, which led you to this! The site you are 
      seeing right now.</p> <br>
      <h3>The tutorial in question:</h3>

      <p>That's all, folks! </p>
