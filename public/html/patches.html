<h4>What do the version numbers mean?</h4>
<p>
    <u>1</u>.0.0
    - the number here (underlined number) is  the major version number. <br>
    1.<u>0</u>.0
    - the number here is the minor version number. <br>
    1.0.<u>1</u>
    - the number here is the patch version. <br>
</p>

<h5>What constitutes a Version / Patch?</h5>
<p>
    A major version is a version with massive overhauls and 
    such as full CSS reworks, total refactoring, full theme changes, etc...
    A minor version is just a version that adds or removes a few small things, 
    and doesn't change the entire website completely (ex: small UI additions constitute
    a "minor" change)
    A patch is just whenever I need to fix something real quick or when I add one part
    of a minor version to test things out
</p>

<h5>Why version 1.0.1? (outdated)</h5>
<p>Well, it's sorta the first version in the version system sooooo...</p> <br>
