<h1>The Great Refactoring</h1>
<p>Good god... As for why the tone has started so poorly, let me give you an explanation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I switched over to VSCode!!</li>
    <li>I moved everything to a <b title="github!!"><a link href="https://github.com/tempestcloudz/cloudzwebsite">Github repo </a></b></li>
    <li>I put everything in a damn folder (for organization's sake, I don't like keeping it cluttered)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, what did this do?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this first of all made everything a whole lot more convenient for me! I no longer have to manually update everything and access files using 
    Neocities' built in editor (I absolutely loved it when starting, but VSCode+Github intergration helps a loooot with the process.)
</p>
<p>An unforseen consequence of this is that the urls are <em>ever so slightly</em> different, see if you can spot it.</p>

<a title="It's the /html/!"><img src="https://cloudyblogz.neocities.org/images/url1.png" height="25" length="50" alt="didn't load? check your internet connection."> </a> <br>
<p>Unfortunately, something <em>inconvenient</em> happened next! <b>all. the. links, css, images, broke.</b></p>
<h3>this is what it looked like with broken CSS</h3>

<p>That made me scratch my head for a bit, until I figured out I had to refactor all the "href" links (which was annoying, but worth it.)</p>
<h4>What does that mean for you guys?!</h4>
<p>Nothing. Just kidding! Almost nothing, all it means is that the quality and speed of my web-dev journey will be better and faster! So thats something.</p> <br>
<p><em>code boxes and better web-design coming soon!</em></p><br>

<p>That's all, folks!</p>
